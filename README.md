# SimpleVulnerability

Hey -- this project is a very, very simple repository that has a very basic, easily corrected security vulnerability in it. 

It is useful for following along with the blog post here on the Checkmarx blog:

It consists of this readme file and a simple javascript file with a very simple cross-site scripting vulnerability.

It also has two branches -- `main` and `dev`.  

You can use this repository to easily track the flow of creating, finding, and then fixing a security vulnerability.
